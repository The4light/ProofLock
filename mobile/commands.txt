Terminal One: Backend Server
This starts your Node.js API. It connects to MongoDB and handles the Cloudinary logic we just stabilized.

Bash
cd backend
npm run dev


2. Terminal Two: Frontend (Expo)
This starts the Metro Bundler. Since you are using Expo, this is what serves the React Native code to your device or emulator.

Bash
cd frontend
npx expo start


3. Terminal Three: Network Tunnel (Ngrok)
Since you are testing on a real device, you need to expose your local port 5000 so the phone can talk to your laptop.

Bash
ngrok http --ngrok http --url=rosamaria-uncopiable-willfully.ngrok-free.dev 5000
